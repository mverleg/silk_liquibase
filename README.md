Silk Liquibase
===============================

Silk Liquibase is a [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) extension that generated a [Silk](https://github.com/mverleg/silk) schema from Liquibase changelogs.

If your whole database is recorded in Liquibase (a baseline), you can use this extension to create or update a Silk schema. This schema artifact can subsequently be used as input for other processes like code generation.
